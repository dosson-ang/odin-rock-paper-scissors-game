The is my first project of the JavaScript Basics section of the Foundations course of the Odin Project. This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that is played entirely in the console of the Chrome DevTools. The game is between the Player and the Computer and it plays five rounds, keeps track of the scores after every round and declares a winner at the end or a tie if the scores between the Player and the Computer are equal. I was able to implement my knowledge that I learned from the lessons before this project such as creating variables, knowing when to use the correct operators, conditional statements, functions, and a little bit of for loops.
