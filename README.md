The is my first project of the JavaScript Basics section of the Foundations course of The Odin Project. This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that is played entirely in the console of the Chrome DevTools. The game is between the Player and the Computer and it plays five rounds, keeps track of the scores after every round and declares a winner at the end or a tie if the scores between the Player and the Computer are equal. I was able to implement my knowledge that I learned from the lessons before this project such as creating variables, knowing when to use the correct operators, conditional statements, functions, and a little bit of for loops.

Update after I have finished the DOM Manipulation and Events lesson of The Odin Project: Now that I've learned how to manipulate the DOM using DOM methods and events, I applied my knowledge to this project and edited the code. Instead of the webpage having a prompt for the Player to type in their choice and the RPS game results being displayed on the console, now there is three buttons on the webpage that the player can choose from and the results of the game will also be displayed on the webpage after every round, and the overall winner of the game once either the Player or the Computer reaches a total score of five poinnts. I have also learned about Git branching and merging as I did all of the editing of the code on a separate branch named rps-ui before I merged that branch to the main branch.
